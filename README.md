# Solar System Simulator

A 3D interactive web-based solar system simulator that demonstrates how planets orbit around the sun. This project uses Three.js for 3D rendering and provides an educational visualization of our solar system.

## Features

- Realistic 3D visualization of the solar system
- Planets orbiting around the sun with approximate relative sizes and distances
- Day counter to track the passage of time in the simulation
- Controls to speed up, slow down, or pause the simulation
- Interactive camera controls to explore the solar system from different angles
- Saturn's rings visualization
- Starry background for immersion

## Technologies Used

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- JavaScript for simulation logic
- HTML/CSS for the user interface
- Vite as the build tool and development server

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173)

## Controls

- **Slower**: Reduces the simulation speed by half
- **Pause/Resume**: Pauses or resumes the simulation
- **Faster**: Doubles the simulation speed
- **Mouse/Touch**: Drag to rotate the view, scroll/pinch to zoom

## Simulation Details

The simulation includes all eight planets of our solar system with approximate relative sizes and orbital periods. While not perfectly to scale (which would make the inner planets too small to see), the simulation maintains the correct order and relative relationships between the planets.

## Prompts for Enhancing This Project

Here are some prompts that would help enhance this project:

1. "Add planet information cards that appear when clicking on a planet"
2. "Implement realistic planet textures using image maps"
3. "Add moons orbiting around the planets"
4. "Create a toggle for showing/hiding orbit paths"
5. "Add a feature to jump to specific dates or planetary alignments"
6. "Implement a mini-map or navigation panel for easier solar system exploration"
7. "Add asteroid belt visualization between Mars and Jupiter"
8. "Create a night/day cycle visualization for Earth"
9. "Add comet trajectories through the solar system"
10. "Implement a scale slider to adjust the relative sizes and distances" # solar-cursor-demo
